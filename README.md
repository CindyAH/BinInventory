# BinInventory - Cindy Houck
## Notes - things left out in the interests of time
- I didn't make all the functions properly use business objects.  The best example is the controller's AdjustItemCount method.
- I didn't bother persisting any changes anywhere.  There are comments and warnings and failed tests to keep track of that lack.
- I took the instructions "Your team is tasked with building the inventory Bin maintenance portion that will store what inventory is contained within each bin." and "The actual Items in the catalog will come from another internal team." to heart and didn't bother with any item maintenance other than within bins.

## I really enjoyed talking to all of you and hope to end up working with you!
